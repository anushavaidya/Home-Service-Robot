# Home-Service-Robot

Project 5 of Udacity's "Robotics Software Engineer" nanodegree program 


## Overview 

The objective of this project was to build a Home Service Robot using ROS. It basically involved:
 
### Mapping 
* Create a test_slam.sh script file and launch it to manually test SLAM.
* A functional map of the environment should be creYou will create a test_navigation.sh script file to launch it for manual navigation test.
Your robot should be able to navigate in the environment after a 2D Nav Goal command is issued.
You will create a pick_objects.sh file that will send multiple goals for the robot to reach.
The robot travels to the desired pickup zone, displays a message that it reached its destination, waits 5 seconds, travels to the desired drop off zone, and displays a message that it reached the drop off zone."ated which would be used for localization and navigation tasks.

### Localization and Navigation
* You will create a test_navigation.sh script file to launch it for manual navigation test.
* Your robot should be able to navigate in the environment after a 2D Nav Goal command is issued.
* You will create a pick_objects.sh file that will send multiple goals for the robot to reach.
* The robot travels to the desired pickup zone, displays a message that it reached its destination, waits 5 seconds, travels to the desired drop off zone, and displays a message that it reached the drop off zone.

### Home Service Functions 

* You will create a add_marker.sh file that will publish a marker to rviz.
* The marker should initially be published at the pickup zone. After 5 seconds it should be hidden. Then after another 5 seconds it should appear at the drop off zone. The student should write a home_service.sh file that will run all the nodes in this project.
* The student's home service robot should be simulated as follow:

Initially show the marker at the pickup zone.
Hide the marker once your robot reach the pickup zone.
Wait 5 seconds to simulate a pickup.
Show the marker at the drop off zone once your robot reaches it.

## What you will need to run:

* Gazebo >= 7.0
* ROS Kinetic 
* ROS Navigation Package 
sudo apt-get install ros-kinetic-navigation
* ROS map_server package 
sudo apt-get install ros-kinetic-map-server
* ROS move_base package 
sudo apt-get install ros-kinetic-move-base
* ROS amcl package 
sudo apt-get install ros-kinetic-amcl

## How to run:
* Meet the aforementioned Prerequisites and Dependencies 
* Clone this repository 
* Open this repository, make and source 
cd /home/workspace/catkin_ws/
catkin_make
source devel/setup.bash
* Launch the home service robot 
./src/scripts/home_service.sh

## Note:
* Make sure you change the path directories to catkin_ws in the shell scripts 
* Details of each shell scripts is given in the script folder 
* It is recommended to update and upgrade your environment before runnong the code
