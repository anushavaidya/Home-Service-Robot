# Shell Scripts

## test_slam.sh 
This script is used to create a map of the world your robot is deployed in. 
The shell script test_slam.sh will deploy a turtlebot inside your environment which can be controlled with keyboard commands using the teleop_keyboard node. It is interfaced with a SLAM package so as to create a map of the environment. The map can be visualised by using rviz.

## test_navigation.sh 


## pick_objects.sh


## add_markers.sh


## home_service.sh


# Note:
* If you are using a different world/environment, make sure to change the word_file and map_file path in the shell script.
